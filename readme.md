If you want to make your own Citron pkg read below!

1. If you make a Citron Pkg for a lang that already exists, you won't be featured in "Repo".

1a. If we make a package for the language you made one for, your's will be removed.

2. If making a package take the proper precautions, citron works with certain things.

2a. Make sure your package opens a server at `localhost:80` (most of the time)

2b. Your package must use websockets with it's server.

2c. Make sure the user can change the port.

3. Please specify if your package is made for citron. Don't make your package name `robloxclientcontroller` and then include "Works with citron" in description.
